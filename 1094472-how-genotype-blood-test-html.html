Overview</h2><p class=align-left>For this, there is no need to decode the entire genome, especially since it is the same for all of them. We only need snippets - rare parts of DNA that can be different, making, for example, some blondes, other brunettes, and third red. Geneticists know about 10 million snaps, that is, 10 million places on DNA, where point mutations occur - differences in the genetic programs of different people by one nucleotide, one letter of the genetic code. Today medics may be interested only in a few hundred snippets, about the impact of which there is more or less verified information.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5aa352e948a29bb1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Scientists find simple, safe method to destroy 'forever chemicals'</span></p></a><h2>2. Types of genotype</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5aa352e948a29bb1.jpg><p class=align-left>The genotype (from the Greek word Genos - genus and typos - imprint, sample, type) is the aggregate of all genes of the cell (organism) localized in the nucleus (chromosomes) or in different replicating structures of the cytoplasm (mitochondria, plastids, plasmids, etc.). In a narrow sense, the term genotype is used to refer to those genes whose inheritance is studied in this case, for example, genotype Ac or genotype Aa.</p><p class=align-left>Even in the organisms with the same system of genotype, (in case developing them in different external conditions) sharply distinctive features may appear, that is, the type of the genotype is characterized by the rate of reaction - the limits of the variability of the trait. The norm of the reaction arises in response to any fluctuations in the environment where the development of the organism takes place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt26jscnhuqe8g.jpg><p class=align-left>A genotype is an integral system, all of whose genes interact with each other, affect each other and form a certain phenotype.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ac6f2a3b188a0602.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Studies to see if mutations behind monkeypox spread: WHO</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Therefore, the manifestation of each gene depends on its genotypic environment. Genes in the genotype by type of interaction can be:</p><li>Epistatic - to suppress the action of other non-allelic genes;</li><li>Hypostatic - those that are suppressed by the genes of another allelic couple;</li><li>Pleiotropic genes – they can affect the manifestation of several symptoms simultaneously;</li><li>Fatal genes - those that reduce the viability of the embryo, even to his death;</li><li>Sublethal genes - significantly reduce the viability of the individual, cause death before the beginning of the reproductive period;</li><li>Modifiers - those that alter the manifestation of other (other) genes;</li><li>Mutators - such that dramatically change some signs of the body and the preferences of the person.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3m21ioaf4vt.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Moringa weight loss benefits you should know</p><p class=align-left>Every day more and more knowledge about types of genotype in human beings is experiencing by scientists, so they even do not have time to comprehend new information. But it is already clear that soon genetic testing will become a routine mass procedure, the most important link in personalized medicine of the near <a href=#>future</a>. Looking at the patient's genetic map, the doctor will prescribe him a treatment taking into account the characteristics of his body, including individual responses to different medications.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1c10efc77c8c185.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Weeks after Yinka Ayefele stood on his feet, this paralysed woman walks for the first time ever (see video)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>So far, however, it is difficult to find such doctors in Nigeria. But you can do something yourself. For example, take an example from the American geneticist Michael Snyder, who, after discovering predisposition to diabetes in his genome, began to monitor the blood sugar level, changed diet, and lifestyle. Or from a well-known journalist who decided to undergo a surgery to remove her breast, having learned from the genetic test that with a probability of 87% she will have a dangerous breast cancer, from which her mother and grandmother have already died.</p><h2>3.

For example, AC genotype and SC genotype.</p><p class=align-left>Our blood is made of different cells suspended in plasma. So the red blood cells are the main focus in learning genotype as they contain within them hemoglobin, a substance which helps to transport the oxygen to our tissues.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f19a51346b459a26.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Restructuring Nigeria’s overbloated academic curricular by Moshood Olajide (opinion)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Hemoglobinopathy is a serious genetic disorder, which is caused by abnormal polypeptide chains of hemoglobin. There are a few types of the hemoglobinopathies.</p><h3>4. AS genotype symptoms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1i3s7s1264co.jpg><p class=align-left>It is always found in sickle cell anemia. In this case, the alpha chains are considered normal and the beta chains are abnormal. The sickle-cell disease happens when the sixth amino acid, glutamate, becomes replaced by valine to change its structure and functioning in general. Valine is hydrophobic, it causes the hemoglobin to collapse on itself occasionally. When enough hemoglobin collapses on itself the red blood cells become sickle-shaped.</p><h3>5. AC genotype symptoms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1c10efc77c8c185.jpg><p class=align-left>Hemoglobin C trait results when the gene for hemoglobin C is inherited from one parent (mother or father) and the gene for hemoglobin A from the other.

Because 10% of blacks carry the Hb S trait, the heterozygous SC combination is more common than homozygous Hb C disease. The anemia in Hb SC disease is milder than the anemia in sickle cell disease; some patients even can have normal Hb levels. Most symptoms are those of sickle cell disease, but symptoms are usually less frequent and less severe. However, retinal hemorrhages and gross hematuria, aseptic necrosis of the femoral head are also common.</p><h2>7.

There is the site of the California company 23andMe, which promises an exciting journey into the world of your genes. This is the most popular project, created with the money of the head of <a href=#>Google</a> Sergey Brin and his wife Anna Vojitski. Time Magazine recognized 23andMe as the best invention of 2008 (the Large Hadron Collider was awarded only the second place).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6079a88c5badab6a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Infinix to launch most powerful gaming and entertainment smartphone ever</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The name hints at 23 chromosomes containing all the genetic information.

In Nigeria, too, there are several laboratories offering genetic testing, but for the much more expensive price.</p><p class=align-left>But if you’ve decided to use the American company to find out your genotype, then you have to spit in a test tube (it's not easy: there's a lot needed) send your saliva and a month later on the site 23andMe you get the test results.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/85b44f187227b67f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ladies with big thighs, fat hips will live longer, these are the people who won't - Study shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A set that 23andMe is sent by mail to those wishing to undergo genetic testing. In the box - instructions and a test tube for saliva. It is necessary to spit to fill the whole test tube, in the instructions for the strengthened salivation it is recommended to rub your cheeks for 30 seconds. Having done the job, you need to close the test tube and send it back to 23andMe.</p><h2>8.

Not everyone, of course, will want to know what he will die from, and the company will meet half-hearted customers: information on some of the most terrible diseases can be traced only by confirming one's determination and reading different warnings that this is not a verdict.</p><p class=align-left>After reading about your predisposition to illness, you may feel disappointed: you may not recognize anything special. The most terrible thing, for example, may be the risk of venous thromboembolism. However, in this section, the lack of news is the best news.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/58b3d9388f7e62ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>REPORT: How COVID-19 increased child labour in Lagos state (parents, children share experiences)</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2fff90ac765a7cc9.png><p class=align-left>In addition, you can learn about your increased sensitivity to a couple of pills, and also that you are not a carrier of several dozen bad genes of various little-known diseases like the Mediterranean fever.</p><p class=align-left>In general, the good news may be that your genes are not disappointed, and the bad news is that you do not find any essential information that you can use to benefit your health. It is not surprising: hundreds of thousands of genes affect the likelihood of many diseases, besides, we know very little about the mechanisms of this influence. A bit more curious may be the section on genetically inherited traits: among other things, you may learn that you do not blush with alcohol, absorb the milk, not prone to baldness and you have the muscles of a sprinter, not a marathon runner.</p><h2>9. Nationality and ancestors</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6obo1bpvusa.jpg><p class=align-left>You may also learn about your ancestors.
