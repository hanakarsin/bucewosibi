And those who aren't super familiar with the case may be wondering where he is now.</p><p>Sowell was a convicted rapist and <a href=#>murderer</a> and had even served time in prison for attempted rape prior to the discovery of the bodies at his home.

He was on death row when he was transferred to the end-of-life care unit at Franklin Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cleveland.com</a>, Sowell suffered from a terminal illness, but the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction did not specify what it was.</p><p>Sowell was originally scheduled to be executed in October 2012. After his attorneys filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">motion for stay of execution</a> and it was granted, he remained on death row. Sowell also tried to have his conviction overturned, but in December 2016, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohio Supreme Court</a> rejected it.</p><p>In 2021, at the age of 61, Sowell died in a medical prison.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/WKYC Channel 3 News</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Anthony Edward Sowell served jail time before he was convicted of murder.</h2><p>Years before Sowell was convicted of rape, murder, and kidnapping, he pled guilty to attempted rape. In 1989, a woman filed a police report claiming that Sowell had tied her up and choked her when she attempted to leave his home.</p><p>He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and was released in 2005. And for years before his eventual arrest in 2009, people who came into Sowell's home and lived near him reported a foul smell in the area.</p><p>The odor was chalked up to a sausage shop located next store, but when the 11 decaying bodies were found on Sowell's property, it was clear what everyone had been smelling for years. Although Sowell's conviction, sentencing, and eventual death may have given the families of the victims some sense of closure, some were also awarded a settlement by the city of Cleveland.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hoping the families of <a href=#>#AnthonySowell</a> victims can now find some peace.</p>â€” Cleveland Orchestra Chorus (@COChorus) <a href=#>July 22, 2011</a></figure><p>Six families <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit</a> against the city for allegedly failing to properly investigate a rape case against Sowell in 2008, allowing him to remain free and potentially murder and rape more women. $1 million was divided among the six families in the case.</p><p>However, no amount of money could provide enough justice to the families of the victims of the Cleveland Strangler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkaPBqbvNsmSenKeWv6V50qiunqScYruwww%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./theresa-caputo-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Long Island Medium Theresa Caputo's Net Worth Revealed">&larr;
