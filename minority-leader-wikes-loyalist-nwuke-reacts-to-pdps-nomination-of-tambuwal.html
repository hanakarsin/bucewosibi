Tambuwal is a classic example of what played out on the floor of the parliament. Mulikat Akande was the official candidate of the PDP in the 7th Assembly during the Jonathan era but Tambuwal ran against what could be considered party directive and won. He became Speaker.</p><p>“Ndudi Elumelu is also a recent example. He was not the choice of the PDP machine but he was elected minority leader of the House of Representatives. The heavens did not fall.</p><p>“The PDP has interests. Those outside of the PDP who belong to other parties have their onterintereststhe end of the day, those who enjoy the support of their colleagues will be elected into majority and minority positions. As a person, Tambuwal will discover how popular the decision to field him is at this point on the floor.”</p><p>Meanwhile, indications are that Tambuwal might have to face a tougher battle ahead as Wike has reportedly met with the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio to influence the outcome of the position.</p><p>However, this platform gathered that the All Progressive Congress (APC) caucus has not finalised the list of principal officers.</p><p>It was learnt that the caucus meeting of the ruling party has been scheduled for July 10, where the lawmakers would decide but no consensus had yet to be reached on the nominations.</p><p>Party sources also attributed the delay to the contest between Senator Ali Ndume and Opeyemi Bamidele for the Senate majority leader position.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49tZqahnqS%2FqsDYZqOemZSav27DyKScrGWcpMaiuMisq2amp6q4pnnRnpicrKNiwbB5z52nrGWepLqqusCtoKimXaSzbsDAppmur5GhfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-do-you-meme-basic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="25 Memes About Being Basic You'll Def Relate To">&larr;
