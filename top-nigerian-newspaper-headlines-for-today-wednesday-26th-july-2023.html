style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to the <strong>Naija News</strong> roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today, Wednesday, 26th July 2023.</p><p>President Bola Tinubu will unveil his long-awaited list of Ministerial nominees within the next 48 hours, according to the Senate.</p><p>This information comes as the President seeks solitude to make well-considered decisions about the nominees.</p><p>The Senate is urging Nigerians to join in prayer for the President’s sound judgement in the coming 24 hours, in the hope that the outcome will please the population.</p><p>This announcement was made by Senate Leader, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, APC, Ekiti Central, during his 60th birthday celebration and book presentation on Leadership and Communication at the Yar’Adua Centre in Abuja.</p><p>In a new twist to the Labour Party (LP) leadership saga, the party’s factional National Chairman, Alhaji Lamidi Apapa, has urged a Federal High Court in Abuja to order the Inspector-General of Police to remove the suspended National Chairman, Julius Abure, from the party’s national secretariat.</p><p>Apapa and his co-plaintiffs, which include Alhaji Lawal Saleh, the Acting National Secretary, and Comrade Anslem Eragbe, the National Youth Leader, have lodged a suit requesting a permanent injunction to prevent Abure and three other suspended national officers from continuing to claim they are the national chairman and officers of the party.</p><p>The plaintiffs also want the court to nullify all actions taken by the defendants since they were restrained by the FCT High Court and subsequently suspended by the Labour Party’s National Executive Council (NEC) on May 3, 2023.</p><p>The Senate has directed the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the 11 Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos) to put a stop to their proposed tariff increase.</p><p>Naija News reports that this and other resolutions of the Red Chambers followed its consideration of a motion titled: “Need to halt proposed increase in Electricity Tariff by 11 successor Electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos).”</p><p>The motion was moved by Senator Yunus Abiodun Akintunde (APC – Oyo Central) at plenary.</p><p>The Senate urged DisCos to henceforth allow Nigerian communities to recover their cost of buying electricity transformer before asking them to pay bills, calling on them to halt estimated billing by urgently supplying all electricity consumers with prepaid meters at affordable rates across the country.</p><p>President Bola Tinubu on Tuesday met with immediate past National Chairman and Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Senators Abdullahi Adamu and Iyiola Omisore.</p><p>Naija News reports that the duo met with the president at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p><p>Although no official confirmation about the reason for the meeting between the trio, it was gathered that the meeting must have been part of efforts to sort out issues surrounding the party’s leadership</p><p>The suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele has been granted bail in the sum of N20 million and a surety in like sum.</p><p>Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, granted the bail in a ruling on Tuesday.</p><p>The judge rejected the Federal Government’s bail application and the claim that Emefiele was a flight risk, saying that the plaintiff failed to provide any facts to support its claim.</p><p>After listening to the submissions of Emefiele’s counsel, Joseph Daudu (SAN), the presiding judge said the charges against Emefiele are bailable.</p><p>The Department of State Services (DSS) has arraigned the suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, in court.</p><p>Naija News reports that DSS operatives arrived alongside Emefie at the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, around 9:18 am on Tuesday.</p><p>Emefiele is scheduled to be arraigned before the presiding judge, Justice Nicholas Oweibo, on a two-count charge of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition.</p><p>The Academy Staff Union of the Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, protested on Tuesday over the suspension of the institution’s Rector, Dr Tajudeen Odetayo.</p><p>Academic activities were grounded, as staff members claimed the suspension of the Rector was an aberration of its constitution.</p><p>Recall that the Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, suspended the institution’s rector following an allegation of corruption leveled against him.</p><p>According to a July 11, 2023 memo by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Muritala Jimoh, addressed to the Acting Registrar of the polytechnic, Odetayo is facing an investigation over “allegations of financial recklessness, corruption and misappropriation of funds and abuse of office.”</p><p>On Tuesday (today), former Governor of Edo State, Senator Adams Oshiomhole, tendered a verbal apology to his colleagues at the 10th National Assembly after alleging on live television that Senators in the 9th Senate looted their offices, carting away office furniture and equipment.</p><p>Naija News recalls that Oshiomhole had, on Sunday, while appearing live on Channels Television Politics Today programme, alleged that some lawmakers from the previous assembly looted items such as carpets and TVs from their offices.</p><p>According to him, a development that led to most of the federal lawmakers in the 10th national assembly using their money to put their offices in shape.</p><p>The Accountant General of the Federation, Oluwatoyin Madein, reassured on Tuesday that July 2023 salaries for civil servants will not be delayed.</p><p>The promise comes in the wake of previous delays in the payment of May and June 2023 salaries.</p><p>Madein clarified the situation during a conversation with journalists in Abuja.</p><p>She explained that the previous delays were due to unforeseen difficulties outside the control of the Office of the Accountant General.</p><p>The Labour Party (LP) has expressed its intent to contest the court’s decision to remove Hon. Ngozi Okolie, the representative of the Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.</p><p>The party found the Tribunal ruling unexpected and alarming, as it firmly believes that Okolie’s nomination was carried out in accordance with its established rules and guidelines.</p><p>The Labour Party communicated its surprise and plans to appeal in a statement released on Tuesday, penned by National Publicity Secretary, Obiora Ifoh, in Abuja</p><p>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
