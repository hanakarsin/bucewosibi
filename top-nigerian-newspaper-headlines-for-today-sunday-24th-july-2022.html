style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today Sunday, 24th July 2022.</h2><p>The Media Adviser to Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Paul Ibe has tackled the Bola Tinubu Campaign Organisation over some points it raised.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;had earlier reported that the Tinubu Campaign Organisation had stated that it was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the PDP’s presidential candidate during an interview with Arise TV.</p><p>The organisation accused the former vice president of violating provisions of the 1999 constitution&nbsp;when he decided to have other business interest as a young Custom Officer.</p><p>Reacting in a statement sent to Naija News, Atiku’s aide expressed amusement in what he described as a knee jerk response from the Tinubu Campaign Organisation to the “wave making interview granted by Waziri Atiku Abubakar to Arise TV.”</p><p>Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has promised to tell Nigerians the truth about what transpired in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the party’s 2023 presidential candidate.</p><p>Naija News&nbsp;reports&nbsp;Wike&nbsp;made the vow on Saturday in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media,&nbsp;Kelvin Ebiri.</p><p>The aftermath of how Wike felt following the emergence of Atiku as the&nbsp;PDP&nbsp;presidential candidate and the subsequent emergence of&nbsp;Ifeanyi Okowa&nbsp;as his running mate has been shrouded in controversy but the Rivers State Governor has promised to expose everything.</p><p>He said, “On Atiku, I will speak soon and Nigerians will know the actual truth of all that has transpired in the PDP in recent times.”</p><p>The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna State, Sani Uba has debunked reports of any political fight between the party’s vice-presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and Governor Nasir El-Rufai.</p><p>He described the two&nbsp;APC&nbsp;chieftains as brothers, adding that those talking of a rift between them are simply ignorant.</p><p>Sani’s clarification follows the rumours of a cold war between El-Rufai and Shettima over the emergence of the former Borno State Governor as the running mate to&nbsp;Asiwaju Bola Tinubu&nbsp;for the 2023 presidency on the platform of the APC.</p><p>It was reported that El-Rufai was also interested in the VP slot and is therefore not totally happy with the emergence of Shettima.</p><p>The United Nations, UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, has ordered the immediate and unconditional release of the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi&nbsp;Nnamdi Kanu.</p><p>The UN indicted Nigeria and Kenya Governments for the arrest and extraordinary rendition, torture, and continued detention of Nnamdi Kanu without due process.</p><p>The UN Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also asked the Muhammadu Buhari-led government to pay him adequate compensation for the arbitrary violation of his fundamental human rights.</p><p>The group called for the investigation and punishment of government officials and security agents responsible for the torture of the pro-Biafra activist.</p><p>The presidential candidate of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has accused the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s&nbsp;Atiku Abubakar of attempting to deceive both Christians and Muslims.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday by his Media Office signed by Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said Atiku has no business raising the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket except as a hypocrite.</p><p>Recall that Atiku had, during an interview with Arise TV, condemned&nbsp;Tinubu for picking a Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 election.</p><p>Atiku said that he became politically estranged from Tinubu after he presented Ben Obi, a Christian from southern Nigeria, as his vice-presidential candidate in the 2007 election.</p><p>The presidential candidate of&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has berated the presidential candidate of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, for claiming to be part of the founders of the now-defunct Action Congress (AC).</p><p>In a statement on Saturday by his Media Office signed by Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said&nbsp;Nigerians should feel great pity and sadness for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>The former Lagos State Governor said by Atiku’s desperate attempt to win the election by stoking religious bias, he has reduced himself to uttering baseless lies on national television.</p><p>The campaign organisation of the presidential candidate of the&nbsp;All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has punctured holes in the recent interview Atiku Abubakar granted to Arise TV.</p><p>In a statement on Saturday by the Director, Media & Communication,&nbsp;Bayo Onanuga, the Tinubu Campaign Organisation said Atiku bungled his interview with the television station.</p><p>The organisation stated that it was extremely shocked by the many lies and ignorance displayed by the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential candidate.</p><p>The General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly,&nbsp;Tunde Bakare&nbsp;has debunked rumours that he endorsed the All Progressive Congress presidential candidate&nbsp;Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p><p>In a post made on his Facebook page, the clergyman shut down the rumours that he was working against the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on the Muslim-Muslim ticket by Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima.</p><p>Bakare urged Nigerians to disregard the rumours adding that he is a nation builder and would not create diversity amongst the citizenry.</p><p>The Labour Party criticized the presidential candidate of the&nbsp;Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, for saying its presidential candidate, Peter Obi, will not win the election next year.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Arise TV, Atiku, who stated that Peter Obi did not inform him before leaving the PDP, said the&nbsp;Labour Party’s candidate is only popular on social media.</p><p>Atiku added that he is not expecting the LP to pull off a surprise in 2023 because it has no structure and nationwide appeal. He said that the party does not have Governors, members of the National Assembly, and State Assemblies.</p><p>The former vice president asserted that the party would not divide the votes meant for the PDP in some regions, as suggested by some political analysts.</p><p>Abuja-based Pentecostal preacher,&nbsp;Paul Enenche&nbsp;has reacted to the alleged fake clergyman who attended the unveiling of&nbsp;Kashim Shettima, the vice presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC.</p><p>The presence of the bishops at the unveiling sparked various reactions.</p><p>Christian Association of Nigeria and the Nigerian Catholic Church distanced themselves from the persons who appeared in cassocks at the event and described them as impostors.</p><p>Speaking at the event at his Dunamis Church headquarters in Abuja, Enenche described the fake clergymen as “criminals.”</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
