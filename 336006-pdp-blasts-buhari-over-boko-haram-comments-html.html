He said that Nigerians should blame not the military, but President&nbsp;Goodluck Jonathan and his&nbsp;administration.</p><p>Responding to the attacks, the ruling party on December 3 released a statement signed by its&nbsp;National Publicity Secretary,&nbsp;Olisa Metuh, and accused Buhari of playing politics ahead of the next year's polls.</p><p>The PDP also blasted the politician over <a href=#>the comment that he would end insurgency if elected President in 2015</a>, Sahara Reporters provides.</p><p><i>"It is unfortunate that General Buhari, being a former head of state, has continued to play politics with a very serious security challenge which has claimed the lives of many Nigerians by always trying to use the pains of the people to score cheap political points at a time all patriotic Nigerians are joining hands with government to look for solution.</i></p><p><i>"Rather than show patriotism by collaborating with the Federal Government, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant prefers that the nation has no solution until the time he is able to step in as president with his “magic wand” to end the insurgency."</i></p><p>According to the statement, such attitude is an open demonstration of lack of&nbsp;<i>"genuine love and concern for the people. Assuming, without conceding that he has the solution to the problem, should Buhari as a prominent citizen not have put the country first before any selfish political agenda and personal aggrandizement?"</i></p><p>While the Federal Government is demonstrating commitment to setting peace in the country, Buhari continues&nbsp;bringing oil to the fire, the PDP said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Buhari Blasts Jonathan Again</a></p><p><i>"Nigerians appreciate the fact that the Federal Government has been able to sustain the battle to repel the insurgents through the gallant efforts of our armed forces, who have continued to put their lives on the line in defence of our nation and her people.</i></p><p><i>"In the last four years, the Federal Government has deployed huge budgetary allocations towards the fight against terror. Our military, which has suffered years of neglect, is being re-equipped, care is being provided for victims and the displaced while advocacy, consultations as well as national and international collaborations, have been strengthened to find lasting solution to the challenge."</i></p><p>The PDP also commended personally Goodluck Jonathan over demonstrating his commitment "despite the attempts to distract him by unpatriotic elements whose agenda is to destabilize and balkanize the nation as a means to achieve political control".</p><p>Thus, the party characterized Buhari's speech as something associated with "cheap politics" and recalled how the APC aspirant had previously ran for presidency.</p><p><i>"It is on record that in April 2002, preparatory to the 2003 presidential elections, General Buhari urged that Muslims should vote only for Muslims. His statement, which targeted at the very heart of our unity as a nation also sought to promote our nation’s religious fault line as a basis for electing a President.</i></p><p><i>"A stunned nation watched General Buhari flag off his campaign in 2011 in Kaduna with the pen logo of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) held like a spear in his hands and during which he told his supporters to use it (pen) to pluck out the eyes of anybody that tampers with their votes.</i></p><p><i>"As if unmoved by the consequences of his utterances in 2011, General Buhari on May 14, 2012, invoked imagery of bloodshed ahead of 2015 elections while addressing members of his defunct CPC who visited him in Kaduna when he said “If what happened in 2011 (alleged rigging) should happen again in 2015, by the grace of God, the dog and the baboon would be soaked in blood."</i></p><p>The PDP also directed criticism at the APC in general saying they embarrass the nation and the acting administration.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>2015 Elections: There Will Be Revolution Says Buhari</a></p><p><i>"When a founding chairman of APC, Chief Bisi Akande, said a few weeks back in a newspaper interview that the APC had a solution to Boko Haram but would keep it until they got to power, Nigerians wondered if there existed certain links that were more than meet the eyes."</i></p><p>Buhari has failed to introduce any vision on improving Nigeria since he came into politics, the party insisted and therefore urged Nigerians,&nbsp;irrespective of their political leanings, to unite and support the government in its fight against insurgency.</p><p><i>"The time to show support and love for our soldiers and victims of the insurgents is now. Whenever you see a Nigerian soldier smile at him, tell him well-done and wish him well. A united Nigeria remains our only hope for individual and collective growth and greatness. We should not allow comments and statements based on the selfish interests of certain Nigerians to becloud our love for one another."</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHSCj2ltZqiUpXqjuMCsq6xlkqq1or7IZqavnaJir7C3zmafmqqRonqku8ymnKeso2O1tbnL</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ahmed-sobhan-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ahmed Akbar Sobhan - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
