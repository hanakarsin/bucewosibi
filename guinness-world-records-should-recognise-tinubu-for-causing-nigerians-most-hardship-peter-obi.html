Don’t forget that people’s names don’t always make it into the Guinness World Records for only altruistic reasons.</p><p>“So, it depends on which angle he is coming from. If the idea is to put his name in the Guinness Book of Records for causing Nigerians the most hardship – untold hardship, of course he is spot on and I will totally agree with him because his reforms are not achieving what they are meant to achieve.”</p><p>Obi added that he had put the 2023 general elections behind him already and he was now focusing on governance and real issues.</p><p>He stated that the biggest lesson from the 2023 general elections is the fact that Nigerians are actually committed to good governance and not as complacent as people thought they were.</p><p>The former governor noted that Nigerians on the streets could judge the performance of Tinubu so far since he assumed office on May 29, 2023.</p><p>He added:&nbsp;“Well, for me, the biggest lesson (from the 2023 general elections) is the fact that Nigerians are actually committed to good governance. They are not as complacent as people thought they were because they, especially the youths, were actually committed to doing the right thing. That is why they came out in their numbers to participate in the elections.</p><p>“The second lesson is the realisation that the leaders, most people in the elite class are not actually interested in good governance because you can classify the electoral umpire as part of the elite class, the government, all of us are not prepared to do the right thing because if the elites are prepared to do the right thing, the result or the outcome of the election would have been different.</p><p>“But for me the elections have come and gone and I don’t want to talk about the issue of the 2023 elections again. It has come and gone and I am done with it. What I am talking about now are issues of governance because the average Nigerian today is talking about the Nigeria of today, and the Nigeria of tomorrow. That is what is important.”</p><p>Speaking on how he rates the government so far, he said, “That is really a question for the generality of Nigerians to answer. Ask the average Nigerian how he is faring today. The truth is that we have many more Nigerians thrown into poverty, millions of Nigerians don’t know where the next meal will come from. Nobody is sure what the price of a cup of rice, garri or a loaf of bread will be tomorrow. So, it is Nigerians that you should ask the question.</p><p>“It is not a question for me to answer. It is not something I alone will tell you. Ask Nigerians, the masses out there on the streets of Nigeria and you will get a feel of what they are going through. But I know that the situation is critical.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FwZqCtmaO7pr%2FSZq6oqpyZerOxwqipnatdqLWwwcudZKudk6S0r7XSnmStoZ6qr7Z5xaipZpuRqsCqusZmpaKflae2orrSZqSoq6RitaK%2Bw6yfoqhdpbK1sdFmppuhXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-goodman-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Goodman - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
