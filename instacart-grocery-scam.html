And like any business, when you've got more customers to deal with, you've got to plan to deal with more <a href=#>customer service issues</a>.</p><p>And since folks are more likely to talk about the problems that they experienced when working with a specific company or delivery app and maybe forget all of the instances where it worked without a hitch, there has been a huge uptick in gripes people have expressed online. Both employees and customers have lit up their respective social media accounts with situations that can be a real bummer.</p><p>From some delivery drivers experiencing "tip baiting" to customers outright not receiving their orders, if you peruse TikTok enough you're bound to find posts about people's unsavory experiences using delivery applications.</p><p>And this one Instacart experience shared by TikToker @lizkate7 (Katie) is no different. However, her claims sparked a viral debate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My Instacart shopper was definitely trying to scam my ass. HOW do you rationalize substituting a $10 thing of toilet paper for a $29 thing of it? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sWCbwC2Eoz</a></p>‚Äî B. (@TheLazyTarot) <a href=#>December 28, 2021</a></figure><p>In a now-viral TikTok post, Kate claimed that she placed an order through Instacart that totaled some $37. If you aren't familiar with the application, it's basically a delivery service where customers pay a fee to personal shoppers who go to grocery stores, load up their bags with item requests, and deliver them to an address set by the end-user.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our instacart shopper delivered to the wrong address.

Check your orders because the girl that was just shopping mine took my $37 order to $190. When I messaged her saying 'excuse me, I'd never ordered toilet paper, what's happening?' she said 'take it up with customer support'. She then said my order was delivered and never delivered it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>RT: PaleoFoundation: Instacart is a <a href=#>#scam</a>.

Anything that is significantly above the amount of money allotted for an order requires confirmation from the end user.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I took a look at my <a href=#>@instacart</a> history and it's even worse than I thought.
