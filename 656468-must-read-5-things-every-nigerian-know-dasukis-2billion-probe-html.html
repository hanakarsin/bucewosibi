Dokpesi's Confession</strong></p><p>After his arrest by the anti-graft agency, the proprietor of Daar Communications, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, told EFCC operatives that he actually collected N2.1billion from Dasuki, but stated further that the amount was used for campaign and publicity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt38anf95urq6g.jpeg><p>After the statement was made, the media practitioner had his house ransacked by operatives of the commission amid uncertainties about his involvement in the scandal.</p><p>As at the time of filing this report, an EFCC source stated that Dokpesi is among those who they have decided to 'keep' in custody to further help them with investigations.</p><p><strong>â€‹2. Aminu's Arrest</strong></p><p>While everyone was still trying to swallow the fact that the former NSA had been handed over to the EFCC for questioning and further interrogation, news surfaced about the arrest of one of his aides, Alhaji Aminu Baba Kusa, who is believed to be a beneficiary of Dasuki's largess.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1o8udrcesn18.jpeg><p>Kusa, a member of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the chairman of An-Nur Mosque in Abuja, is being accused, alongside his son, of charges ranging from criminal conspiracy, theft, forgery, diversion of public funds, to money laundering.</p><p><strong>3. Dasuki's Revelation</strong></p><p>Nigerians were also stunned when the ex-NSA started listing the names of some top politicians in the country, especially Chief Bode George, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Peter Odili, a former governor of Rivers state in his confessions to the anti-graft agency.</p><p>While Chief George has said that he does not know Dasuki, the former Rivers governor is yet to give any comment on the said revelation by the retired Colonel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1u0r79lsub2g.jpeg><p>But the singular fact that their names were mentioned at all by the EFCC sources point to the fact that they may be involved in one way or the other.</p><p><strong>4. Ex-Minister Bashir Yuguda</strong></p><p>Alongside Dokpesi and other unnamed suspects in the phoney arms deal, a former minister of state for finance, Bashir Yuguda, was nabbed together with other top officials from the office of the NSA over the controversial arms procurement scandal.</p><p>It was revealed further that EFCC sources confirmed that a huge amount of money, running into billions, meant for arms procurement was allegedly traced to the former minister.</p><p>This also clearly points out another anomaly with the scandal for which Dasuki is expected to make further revelations in the coming days.</p><p><strong>5. Former Sokoto state governor, Attahiru Bafarawa</strong></p><p>And in the most bizarre case of all the accused arrested, the Attahiru Bafarawa, a former Sokoto state governor, was said to have informed that he collected the amount linked to him for some 'spiritual' purposes, only for one of his aides, Alhaji Akibu Dalhatu, to issue a statement that it was not so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4mbh3duoecd.jpeg><p>In the statement, the aide noted that the story about the former governor collecting huge amounts of money from the former NSA, was concocted by some media practitioners aimed at rubbishing the image of his boss.</p><p>Dalhatu also informed that Bafarawa was not arrested, he argued that the ex-governor was invited and he honoured the invitation when he returned from his trip abroad.</p><p>Further revelations have since been made by Dasuki, as he informed that he was given an 'oral' permission by the former president Jonathan, to give out the monies which he gave out, and for which he is being&nbsp; presently questioned.</p><p>Nigerians will be waiting with rapt attention to see those who will be further mentioned in the confessions of the ex-NSA boss, as the court has also stalled hearing on his case.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3aCk29vZqWlqMFuvsSam2ZtXam1qrrGrGSerpWnxm66yKCcq6GRo3qsus6wZJ2Zo6q4qr%2BMa5mipJyevK95z6umm51encGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1094472-how-genotype-blood-test-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to know your genotype without blood test?
