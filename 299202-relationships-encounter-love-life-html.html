It’s only the lucky few who find great dating experiences early on; relationships that are built on mutual respect, compatibility, and sexual attractions. The rest, where most of us belong, would have to go through the numerous types of relationships to get an understanding of how functional relationships work.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/01129e47bf694625.jpeg><p class=align-left>Is it true you only fall in love once? This is possible, but many people have fallen in love several times. If you fall in love with the wrong person, you cannot force yourself to continue feeling the same just because you believe it happens only once.</p><h2>Types of relationships</h2><p class=align-left>There are different types of relationships that you may encounter in your life before finally finding long-term happiness.</p><h3>1. The first love</h3><p class=align-left>Your first dating experience is usually a special one, even though it may not have felt like it during the time. The initial serious romantic relationship sets the path for your subsequent relationships. Generally, this attachment helps you know your strengths, areas that need work, how you should communicate, or kiss. You also learn how to trust your partner and how faithful you would wish to be.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/146f78a24baf728a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ quotes about fights in a relationship for your partner</span></p></a><h3>2.The rebound</h3><p class=align-left>All the other relationship types come with their specific set of circumstances. However, none comes out quite as complicated as this one. Rebound relationships occur when you are just from a serious relationship and still nursing the bruises. By pursuing a relationship with another person way too fast, your self-esteem tends to shoot. Basically, this is a period when you fill time with them by doing date-like things till you finally land on the real deal. Most of the time, this relationship is usually unfair to you, your partner, or both.</p><h3>3. Dominating</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/146f78a24baf728a.jpeg><p class=align-left>At a point between your dating adventures, unfortunately, you will be in a relationship with someone who is really controlling. They will set the relationship rules for you to follow, yet something about them will keep you spineless. You may never even notice how ridiculous the rules are and end up missing dates with friends, avoiding male acquaintances, or even spending your holidays with their family instead of yours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/84775da1306559b8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 subtle signs of relationship abuse and what you should do</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The spell that keeps you beside your partner will be evident to your friends or relatives, but for some reason it will not be vivid to you. Most of the time, you will be free to speak your mind or demand anything from this person, and this may not be really healthy.</p><h3>4. The clingy one</h3><p class=align-left>Being a clingy partner mostly comes from insecurities. In most cases, the clingy partner may have gone through broken trust in a past relationship and carried this on to the current one. This usually ends up quite annoying, but it does not mean that you should ditch your new love for this.</p><h3>5. Independent</h3><p class=align-left>This is also another special kind of dating where you are just the ideal ‘power couple’, or at least, you believe you are. What really happens in this setup is that you are two individuals who are not willing to sacrifice or compromise for your relationship. Occasionally, you will put your interests ahead of your partner, and the same applies to them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/cf339000f4853033.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to stop loving the father of your child as a single mom</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You’re both dedicated to your career and have separate social lives. Essentially, you just meet up at that time when it is convenient for both, but love is the least priority.</p><h3>6. Codependent</h3><p class=align-left>This is the exact opposite of the independent one where none can function without their partner. You may feel anxious or depressed when he/she is not around and this makes other aspects of your life to suffer. To keep the person’s love, you will end up doing out of the ordinary things – like cancelling a trip that you had already planned with your friends years ago, just to stay with the person. You definitely have heard of people giving up great job opportunities.</p><h3>7. Opposites attract</h3><p class=align-left>This is a common scenario among many couples, and you may find yourself going out with someone you have nothing in common with. No common beliefs, no shared hobbies, just having each other as the common bond. This relationship may be a blessing since the attributes or characters of both parties may tend to balance out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c080f0700572d346.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><h3>9. Good on paper</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes, you may be in a relationship with someone not because you like them, but because you believe you are supposed to be in love with such a person. Take this dating type, for example. You don’t have feelings for him/her, but they are good looking, sweet, funny and have a good job. He/she is definitely marriage material, so you stay ‘in love’ with them.</p><p class=align-left>The relationship is usually a great one. You spend great times together, your partner treats you well, and your family and friends absolutely like them. But something is just missing; that little spark which reminds you that he or she is the one.</p><h3>10. Long distance relationships</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/a9e37adcb4a20bdc.jpeg><p class=align-left>This is one of those relationship types that only the brave ones take part in. You will have to come to terms with the fact that you need the person beside you despite the distance, and promise yourself that it is not such a big deal being away from the love of your life and that you will succeed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5aa879800d66801e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are usually many challenges accompanying this form of dating, but it is possible through effective communication and trust.</p><h3>11. Friends with benefits</h3><p class=align-left>You’ll also have the opposite to the basically friends relationship: the purely sexual one. When you call or text one another, it’s almost always to spend time immediately. You’re mostly in the bedroom together. You have great sexual chemistry, and for some reason never feel compelled to explore your chemistry in other areas.</p><h3>12. Open relationships</h3><p class=align-left>At some point in life, you may get a little new age and give an open relationship a try. Here, the partners may be emotionally committed to each other, but are free to spend time and sleep with other individuals. In most instances, the relationship turns out successful only if both parties have no emotional investment in one another, and this is the biggest reason why such a relationship ends anyways.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e307adda0fd9ba6b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The most rib-cracking love quotes of all time</span></p></a><h3>13. Feels more like friendship</h3><p class=align-left>As opposed to the examples above, you may also end up feeling more like friends than a couple. This is the first person you dial their number for a fun night out or spend a lot of time together that you find yourself dating. Everything here is great except one thing; when it turns to the cozy direction, your blood runs cold and opt out.</p><h3>14. Toxic</h3><p class=align-left>This may be the most exhausting relationships you will ever find yourself in.</p><p class=align-left>When in a relationship, you need to feel happy, special, and secure, but this is the exact opposite. It mostly seems great at first, until you begin to see your partner’s true colors. Signs of this kind of relationship include excessive criticism, passive aggressive behaviour, verbal or physical abuse, and a severe lack of getting the same favours you give your partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhsh3j06p7a3g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>6 tips on how to get over someone you like fast</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even worse, toxic relationships pull down your self-worth and this further makes it hard for you to leave. Just like being on a drug, the highs get really high, but the lows will always leave you incapacitated.</p><h3>15. Prize possession</h3><p class=align-left>At some point you will be in the arms of a rich or insanely good looking partner because you are just intrigued by what it feels to have them in your life. You have definitely come across ‘gold diggers’ who seem contented with their filthy rich men or a that giddy friend who always dates models. So you decide to give it a try.</p><p class=align-left>If you are emotionally sound, you will definitely not carry this for long and find yourself craving for a real connection.</p><h3>16. Emotional affair</h3><p class=align-left>At first, you may not realize that you are getting into an emotional affair, so here is a freebee. At one point, you may end up developing an emotional, intimate connection with a man or woman who already has someone with them. Similarly, it may be you who is in a committed relationship. So here, nothing happens, but this is the person with whom you may share your secrets. You get anxious whenever you are going to meet him or her, and you if you try to think about it, news of the meeting may not go along well with your partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs4dkur723ing.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brainy Quotes about Friendship and Love</span></p></a><h3>17. The one</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/84775da1306559b8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Meeting your true love feels like constant burst of butterflies in the stomach. Of course, you have finally met someone that you believe is your match – the one you want to be beside you for the rest of your life. You can tell that you have finally found the one if you hold serious conversations about your future as a couple, have fun together, and plan the future. You also have trust and open communication, agree on the biggest things in life, sacrifice for each other, receive positive reinforcement, and make each other better.</p><p class=align-left>Finding the one is the most satisfying of the relationship types out there. Just remember that you have to go through a few dud relationships to find the right one for you.</p><p class=align-left>Of all these types of relationships, none is as satisfying as finding the one. So anytime you are going through a dud relationship, just know that it is part of the process of getting the person you feel you deserve.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>How to know she truly loves you</li><li>The most rib-cracking love quotes of all time</li><li>Tips on how to learn how to swim</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BmHJpaWpdp7KtrdOipqermJ69tHnEp5qorZ6psrN5y6itnmWcnrOmesetpKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./senate-leadership-visits-tinubu-in-aso-rock-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Senate Leadership Visits Tinubu In Aso Rock (Photos)">&larr;
