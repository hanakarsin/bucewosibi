Although he won many Super Bowls and awards during his career, Tom has also caused a fair bit of controversy. Some people hate him because of his possible political views, while others just hate him for winning so often.</p><p>Tom wasn't the only polarizing figure in attendance, though. <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> is also a figure people either love or love to hate, and she was greeted by boos when she walked on stage at the event. Now, many want to better understand what those boos are all about and why she received them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Kim Kardashian get booed at the Tom Brady roast?</h2><p>When Kim was introduced by host Kevin Hart, she walked out in a black dress with a glass of champagne in her hand and was almost immediately booed.</p><p>Booers don't often explain why they boo someone, so it's possible that Kim could have been booed for any number of reasons. Kim has been a controversial figure for multiple reasons since she became famous.</p><p>It could be her photo with Donald Trump in the Oval Office, the allegations she frequently faces of appropriation, her relationship with Kanye West, or a hundred other things. Some of these controversies are more justified than others, but it's impossible to know exactly why those who booed her did so. It's also possible that the people who did so each had their own reasons. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that Kim wasn't thrilled by the reaction she received.</p><p>After Kim came to the mic, she said, "All right, all right, all right," and the boos were eventually overwhelmed by cheers for her, which allowed her to continue into her ribbing of Tom.</p><p>In her jokes, Kim referred to the fact that there were once rumors that she and Tom had dated.</p><p>“Speaking of Tom and I dating, I know there were some rumors that we were and I’d never say if we did or not, I’d just release the tape,” she said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>They're booing Kim Kardashian <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bJyHRUAaNY</a></p>— CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) <a href=#>May 6, 2024</a></figure><p>Tom and Kim were first linked after they were spotted together at a party in July 2023, but reports at the time suggested that the two had only shared a short conversation.</p><p>Kim concluded her remarks with a solid quip: “I’m just here tonight to support you and celebrate you. I’ll give you the same advice I give all of my exes: good luck knowing the best is behind you."</p><p>Kim wasn't the only star in attendance for Tom's roast, which also included appearances from former teammates like Julian Edelman, Rob Gronkowski, and Randy Moss, as well as his former coach Bill Belichick. Other than the awkward moment where Kim got some boos, the night largely went off without a hitch. Tom, who has one of the biggest egos in sports, got taken down a peg, but also got his chance to bite back at everyone who roasted him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu26zxK1km6efmrFuwM6mZJuqkZnGbr7Omqqt</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./boko-haram-attack-dikwa-overtake-un-hub-in-borno.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boko Haram Attack Dikwa, Overtake UN Hub In Borno">&larr;
