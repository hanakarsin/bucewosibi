This meeting took about four hours. We have not concluded.</p><p>“You know to make peace takes some time. But, I think we are at it. We are better informed. Every coin has two sides. We have been briefed by His Excellency. We are going back to Abuja to digest all that we have gathered.</p><p>“It has been a very fruitful but one thing we must understand is that this family still remains one under one umbrella called PDP and by the special grace of God, we will end up very victorious. With his (Wike’s) cooperation and the support of all other governors, we will make progress.</p><p>“In concrete terms, it is a work in progress. As I said, we will get there. We will definitely get there. This is the first time members of the Board of Trustees are coming to see His Excellency and for your information, he is also a member of the Board of Trustees. We robbed minds and we will find a solution very soon.</p><p>“Presidential campaign has started and it is the policy of our great party that we all go home and campaign. His Excellency is here and he is campaigning for the party.</p><p>“In Abia State where I come from, we are also campaigning. You know there is no ballot box in Abuja. Everyone on us here is from one zone or the other.</p><p>“Our governor here is a PDP governor. Even if he does not really come out to campaign, he has campaigned with all the projects he has executed in Rivers State as we speak.</p><p>“I said this yesterday to one of your colleagues; I am acting chairman of the Board of Trustees and I do not have the exclusiveness to come out here to tell you what the Board of Trustees will come out with.</p><p>“We are going back and will convene a meeting of the Board of Trustees and that is when Nigerians will hear the decision of the Board of Trustees. Since it is an advisory body and conscience of the party, we will be there to tell the party the truth about our findings and nothing but the truth.”</p><p>Wike speaking after the meeting said, “As the BoT acting chairman said, the most important thing is to have unity. What is important is that the house is united. So, the issue of whether we achieved peace today or not is immaterial.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2O7orXJmqWer6NjsLC5jmtna2pfZn1wfJNomaudkaC2r7OMnZytmZmhwG67xWannahdl7y1edaiq6Flp564pnnEppyrn5Vk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kirsten-collins-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kirsten Collins - Age, Family, Bio">&larr;
