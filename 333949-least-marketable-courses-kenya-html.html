This is because they have little to no job openings in the current employment market. Besides, their demand is predicted to go down in the future.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.png><p class=align-left>At some time before joining the university, you might have wondered what the best degree or diplomas to pursue in Kenya are. While you desire to enrol in a sought-after program, you possibly might want to consider the flooded courses in Kenya to be practical when choosing your career path.</p><h2>Top 20 least marketable courses in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Here are some useless fields in the current and future employment market that are not worth pursuing. They might be considered as valueless as graduates from such programs end up doing some odd <a href=#>jobs</a>.</p><h3>1. Chemical Engineering</h3><p class=align-left>This sounds fishy. Are all engineering courses supposed to be valuable? Well, no. A Chemical Engineering degree is as good as useless in the country. However, there are lots of opportunities available beyond borders in developed states such as Russia and America. What’s worse is that these countries possibly might not regard your Kenyan degree.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14389eead9201781.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adecco chief says AI will create new jobs</span></p></a><h3>2. Mass Media</h3><p class=align-left>Most employers consider your skills more than a degree in this field. It is even not surprising that talented individuals such as Jalang’o, MC Tricky, and the rest are in the media, yet this is not their profession. If you are not artistic and gifted, you should never think of taking Mass Media.</p><h3>3. Political Science</h3><p class=align-left>Many graduates from this discipline have not had the chances to air their political views and showcase critical thinking skills. There are very few opportunities in the line of Mutahi Ngunyi’s profession. Most of the graduates end up settling for some odd jobs.</p><h3>4. Education</h3><p class=align-left>Some subject combinations are no longer needed as the fields have been flooded. Business, History, and CRE are some of the unmarketable blends you can waste your time pursuing in the university. The said subjects are simple, and everyone is opting to take them in college over Mathematics, Geography, Physics, and Chemistry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5d45c31a49c9c84e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KCSE 2023 Results: Courses to Pursue with a D+ and Below, "It is not End of the Road"</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/14389eead9201781.jpg><h3>5. Sport Science</h3><p class=align-left>Upon graduation, you will end up being a gym instructor and a personal trainer. We all agree that only a few people are interested in such a lifestyle. The majority cannot even afford to cater to the services of a graduate.</p><h3>6. Psychology and Counselling</h3><p class=align-left>It is one of the great courses in the country as it involves impacting and changing people’s lives positively. However, getting employed in such a field is next to impossible today.</p><p class=align-left>You can also not start your counselling centre as many Kenyans prefer not to share their problems with anyone. A good number of them are not even aware of the services offered by a psychologist and a counsellor.</p><h3>7. Theology</h3><p class=align-left>Theology is one of the most useless degrees in the country. Unless you have plans of becoming a chaplain or a religious leader, you should never undertake this programme.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a045f2f12ae19be3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 most liberal cities in Texas to live or visit in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even so, you don’t need any certificates to become a pastor nowadays. Anyone can wake up today and claim that God has called him/her to spread the gospel. So, with this in mind, who needs Theology and Biblical classes?</p><h3>8. Criminology</h3><p class=align-left>With the rising insecurity cases in the country, one would think that experts in this field have lots of opportunities. Security firms and chiefs no longer need the services of such experts. With this degree, you will end up settling for something you did not train for.</p><h3>9. Hospitality</h3><p class=align-left>Hospitality includes any catering, hotel management, and related courses. Together they make up the worst courses in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>. Doing such courses requires some “connections” somewhere. Hospitality graduates mostly work in banks and other unrelated fields. It is one of the least marketable courses that you should not pursue.</p><h3>10. Art courses</h3><p class=align-left>Ranging from drama, acting, music, and so on, some art courses are considered to be less serious degrees that only require cramming exam answers and a little creativity. With this in mind, anyone can do them quickly hence, the reason why such fields are usually crowded.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2690c58cd5d24b5e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ speech topics for school assembly presentation for students</span></p></a><h3>11. Physical Education</h3><p class=align-left>Physical Education is also among the least marketable degrees in the country. The programme equips learners with psychomotor knowledge that is aimed at promoting play in secondary and primary education. Today, not many schools are very keen on having the services of such experts.</p><p class=align-left>It is especially true because schools have not been allocated such funds based on the recent budget hence, Physical Education is something you might not want to pursue as a degree.</p><h3>12. Anthropology</h3><p class=align-left>Anthropology is the study of humankind in a broad comparative approach. Graduates here know how societies are formed. With many people opting to pursue the course, it is next to impossible to get hired as there are few to no job openings. Many employers do not need services provided by anthropologists.</p><h3>13. Library</h3><p class=align-left>There are few state-of-the-art libraries in the country. It means that there are few opportunities in this industry. Additionally, top institutions are adopting computer systems that reduce the number of employees they need. Nowadays, a big library can typically be run by one or two librarians and a couple of other support staff such as guards and errand men.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/17dd9e075d8a4470.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Has anyone died on Alone? Here's what we know so far about the show</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5d45c31a49c9c84e.png><h3>14. Records Management</h3><p class=align-left>We are in a brave new world where computers have eradicated the services of record managers. Records Management is one of the least marketable courses that should be avoided at all costs.</p><p class=align-left>Very few companies are currently still using old record-keeping ways such as files, and so on. The said firms do not need an expert in the field as chances are they already have one.</p><h3>15. Animal Husbandry</h3><p class=align-left>Animal Husbandry involves the study of animal and livestock companionship. The country does not have a significant agricultural industry, and so taking this course means that you might find it hard to secure employment. It is therefore among the less viable degrees and diplomas in Kenya as of now.</p><h3>16. Forestry</h3><p class=align-left>Only a few graduates from this course get employed. Few organizations and companies require Forestry experts. Thus, opportunities are limited as only the best get jobs. Now, you don’t want to gamble with your future, so it is advisable to shun away from this programme.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f72438065b1eec43.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 marketable courses that do not require Maths in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>17. Meteorology</h3><p class=align-left>As you might be aware, this field involves weather and climate change in the earth. Well, we have many weather apps in the country, and so your services might not be needed.</p><p class=align-left>Many companies have replaced their meteorology departments with computer systems and <a href=#>apps</a> which are relatively accurate. Also, there are few meteorology centres in the country. Therefore, if you are not outstanding, you will end up doing some odd jobs for the rest of your life.</p><h3>18. Environmental Science</h3><p class=align-left>Environmental Science is one of the least marketable diploma courses in Kenya. At the moment, there are few prospects for diploma holders. Companies need high-level, experienced individuals.</p><p class=align-left>Securing an excellent job will mean getting a lot of experience from paid or unpaid internships. Why waste close to five years working on getting experience without getting paid while you can pursue a sought-for degree?</p><h3>19. Bachelor of Commerce (BCOM)</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/28a832a241257843.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is SmartHela? Can you really make an income from the service?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nearly everyone in the university is taking up BCOM. Although the degree is quite sought-after by employers today, it is one of the least marketable courses. It is predicted that the field will soon be flooded as thousands of people graduate with such certificates every year.</p><h3>20. Masters of Business Administration</h3><p class=align-left>Last on our list of useless courses in the country is the MBA. Well, lots of people out there have furthered their education via this discipline. Many of them even have PhDs, and thus, it is a complete waste of time to undertake this profession. You will end up tarmacking with a very fat CV and valueless certificates.</p><p class=align-left>The above is the least marketable courses in Kenya. All of them have one thing in common. They are flooded, or the services of such experts are no longer viable to employers. However, this should not discourage you from pursuing them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8365390ff63d1457.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Worst businesses to start in Kenya: The top 10 list</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can still take them and get a good-paying job immediately after graduation. You only have to make sure you join a reputable university, pursue other short courses such as <a href=#>CPA</a>, have a good network with friends, do as many internships as you can, go for a postgraduate program, seek opportunities beyond the borders or even employ yourself!</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkmxwbXFdobKiv9NmpJqqm5rBoq7LnmScp6WnwKa%2FjKScp7GRY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./obamas-portrait-memed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Internet Is Memeing Obama's Presidential Portrait">&larr;
