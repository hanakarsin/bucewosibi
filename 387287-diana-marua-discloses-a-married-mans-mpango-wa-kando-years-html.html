At some point, I used to date guys for money. This is because I lacked the whole of my life. All I wanted was to live well. I dated people for money. I dated someone who used to pay my rent, I had someone who would shop for my house and one who would buy me clothes and another one who would take me out. In my early twenties, money for me was not a problem," she said.<p class=align-left>She recounted that at some point, she would shop and stack her fridge to a point that it would not close.</p><p class=align-left>Marua also revealed that she was not a saint and back in the day, she had an 'entanglement' with a married guy.</p>"I remember at some point I was a side chick to a married guy. Guys like I am not telling you this because I am proud of what I did. I am telling you this because they are facts of my life and I want to encourage someone. So I used to date this guy who was married. I liked him a lot. The man told me, "Dee I will not lie to you that I am going to leave my wife for you"... I was a side chick but the guy was good," said Bahati's wife.<p class=align-left>In a related story, Bahati and his wife Marua marked five years of marriage and were not ashamed to highlight their good and bad moments.</p><p class=align-left>The father of four revealed he and his wife had touch and go moments when they felt like their relationship was slipping through the cracks.</p><p class=align-left>According to Bahati, Diana had a tendency of packing and leaving whenever the going got tough.</p><p class=align-left>At one point after the two were involved in a tussle, the musician's better half left with their five-month-old baby Heaven Bahati and did not look back.</p><p class=align-left>In their YouTube channel, the couple laughed as they narrated their painful breakups.</p><p class=align-left>The artiste revealed his partner decided to move in with her ex-lover after ditching their matrimonial home.</p>"Whenever I remember this thing I honestly get so mad.
