Steve apparently died by suicide on June 22, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. Los Angeles County Police say that a man fitting his description jumped from the 27th floor of his luxury apartment building in Century City. Sources close to Steve said that he was depressed because of a lack of contact during the quarantine.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What was Steve Bing known for?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve</a> was best known for his work as a screenwriter and producer in Hollywood. He wrote the script for Kangaroo Jack, and also financed films like Polar Express and the Rolling Stones concert documentary Shine A Light. He was the chair of a production company called Shangri-La Entertainment and hailed from a wealthy family. His last producing credit was on 2016's Rules Don't Apply, although he remained present in Hollywood circles.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How did Steve Bing know Jeffrey Epstein?</h2><p>Steve was known to have a close relationship with the Clintons, who were also friendly with Jeffrey Epstein prior to his arrest. Because both men apparently committed suicide, this has only intensified speculation that the Clintons were somehow involved in Steve's death. "Hard to believe a 55-year-old billionaire #SteveBing suddenly decided to jump off a tall building because he 'was depressed about social isolation during the COVID lockdown' which is over now anyway," one user posted.</p><p>Those comments are based only in speculation, and have little grounding in fact. They merely point out a pattern, and there was no news to suggest that Steve was about to be taken in by authorities for any crimes related to Jeffrey Epstein. Even as his death has led to rampant speculation, it's also led to an outpouring of grief from those who knew him, including his ex-wife Elizabeth Hurley.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Steve Bing's death has also come with plenty of grieving.</h2><p>One user wrote that Steve had helped them achieve one of their dreams. "Just over a year ago, I got to have a dream come true thanks to two generous people I'd never met. One of those people was Steve Bing, who died today. Rest in peace, and all the love to his dear friend @joshuarolson," the user wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. Others wrote about the pain he must have been experiencing and regretted that no one had been able to take it away.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I am saddened beyond belief that my ex Steve is no longer with us.
