The English actor is not only successful in the film industry but also as a singer, writer, producer, rapper, DJ and businessman. He is clear evidence that in this world, there are people who chase success and people who success chases. Idris belongs to the latter. Everything he touches seems to magically turn into success. No wonder he has acclaimed so much fame around the world.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/908788f842ca6ba2.jpeg><p class=align-left>Fame, money and success can never be a complete equation for most without women. Idris Elba is no exception to this rule. Together with the fact that he was named the sexiest man alive by People Magazine, it is evident why women keep coming even if it is just a day of love with the English actor. The man has had his fair share of relationships before and after fame. It is not only women. Everyone wants to have a piece of the star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/60840c0a426486db.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Steve Damstra and Paget Brewster love story and relationship</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Queen Elizabeth II, for instance, appointed him Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to drama. When he went to Sierra Leone where his father is from for the first time, he was given citizenship on arrival. His mother is from Ghana although Idris was born and raised in London.</p><h2>What you need to know about Idris Elba</h2><p class=align-left>Here is everything you need to know about his children, wife, ex-wives and dating history:</p><h3>Wife</h3><p class=align-left>Idris Elba is married to a beautiful wife called Sabrina Dhowre, a former pageant queen. Sabrina is also an actress apart from being a model. Sabrina is 16 years younger than Idris, but the age difference did not come in between their relationship. Sabrina, a former Miss Vancouver, has Somali origins.</p><p class=align-left>Idris and Sabrina started seeing each other some time back in 2017 and made their engagement public the following year. The two met at a jazz bar where People's Sexiest Man Alive 2018 was filming The Mountain Between Us in Vancouver. Idris proposed in a very romantic way doing it live on stage during the screening of his movie Yardie.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f6feabbb94bb397d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the cutest person in the world? Meet 10 most adorable people 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The place where Idris and his wife got married could never be better. They chose to tie the knot in Morocco, a country known for its tourist destinations. It was also a symbolic gesture considering that both of them have African roots.</p><p class=align-left>For their dream wedding, Idris adorned a custom Savile Row suit while his bride was clad in a custom-made wedding gown by Vera Wang. Although the two are yet to have a child, Idris Elba family cannot be complete without his two children he has from different women.</p><h3>Idris Elba ex-wives</h3><p class=align-left>Sabrina Dhowre is Idris Elba's third wife, meaning he has been married twice before. Idris Elba's first wife was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Hanne Kim NÃ¸rgaard</a>. The two were married from 1999 to 2003. This union was blessed with a baby girl who they named Isan Elba who was born in 2002. Despite the divorce, the two have a good relationship, and they raise their daughter together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/3497fb88fdcfda12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Love To Death telenovela cast, episodes, full story, how to watch</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Idris ex-wife and daughter live in Atlanta but always keep in touch with the star. They always come together to celebrate her birthday every January. Hanne Norgaard happens to be a Danish make-up artist and an entrepreneur as well. Idris and Kim met in England when the latter was working as a make-up artist, and they moved to New York after they began to date. Kim remained single for ten years after their divorce but eventually got married again in 2013 to Andrew L. Friar.</p><p class=align-left>Idris' second wife was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Sonya Nicole Hamlin</a> who is a property lawyer. Idris and Sonya were married in 2006 but for a short while. It was somewhat a secret marriage. Idris has been described as a man who loves to love, but his marriages have often ended as soon as they began.</p><p class=align-left>Sonya says that the two were deeply in love, but Idris was influenced by others to leave her. Idris was made aware that she would ruin his Hollywood career. The star obliged that he should be a single-sex symbol in Hollywood and that's how he walked out of the marriage after a few weeks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/aca15a9927f46f1f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Dave Chappelle wife and kids: photos and everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>All eyes are on him to see if the third and current one will last or it will follow the fate of the other two. The difference between other Idris Elba wives and the current one is that the actor knew it was love at first sight, and hopefully, Sabrina captured his heart forever.</p><h3>Dating history</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/60840c0a426486db.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is not easy to keep tabs with the number of women Idris has dated. He was in a ten-year affair with a pole dancer named Desiree Newberry before he married his second wife. Desiree got pregnant and had Idris believe that the baby was his. However, after suspicions arose, a paternity test was conducted, and it revealed that he was not the father.</p><p class=align-left>It left him devastated, and the two had to separate. His son's mother is Idris Elba's ex-girlfriend called Naiyana Garth who he met in 2013. She is a make-up artist. The two broke up when their son was two years old because Idris had multiple infidelities during their time together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5ad39ed600291716.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyashinski traditional wedding: New photos from the event</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The news of their split emerged just a few days after he had been seen leaving a nightclub in New York in the company of a model by the name Naomi Campbell. There are rumours that Idris was also seeing rapper K Michelle at this time.</p><p class=align-left>Idris and Michelle saw each other for about eight months, but he made it clear to her that he would never be committed to one woman. There are also rumours that Idris and singer Madonna had an affair in 2016 even though the Luther star has denied the claims.</p><p class=align-left>Idris Elba has dated women of all shapes, sizes and colours. His long road to finding love led him to Sabrina Dhowre's heart, his third wife. He seems to have found perfect love with this one as he said it was love at first sight. True to that, the two seem to be serious about one another, unlike his previous relationships. Sabrina makes him happy, and in this marriage, there have been no complains or rumours of infidelity. They are always celebrating their love on shows, magazines and even social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8251bf33a5ccf5ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daniel Tosh net worth, wife, house, salary, siblings</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Willis Raburu bio: Wife, family, weight loss, and career</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Fk2pqanFdnrGztdJmnKWakWKwqbXLnamepl2stqexjLCgr52jYrGiwMinnmagmajBsL7YZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vanna-white-hosting-wheel-of-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Vanna White Hosting 'Wheel of Fortune'?
