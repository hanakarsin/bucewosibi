Bright and extraordinary persons try to emphasise their exclusivity with flowers of love. Some people believe that in the age of mobile phones and the internet, it is old fashioned to think about the meaning of flowers when choosing a bouquet even for a lady; but we can assure them that all flowers have their special meaning that can become a message to the person to whom you present a bouquet.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/769650f642343834.png><p class=align-left>The language of flowers was invented in the Ancient East. There it was called "selam." This art is handed down from generation to generation. According to it, each flower and its fragrance have their meaning.</p><h2>Flowers of love</h2><p class=align-left>There is no doubt that when you are presenting a bouquet, you want to be sure that you made a clear choice. And if you make a bouquet, given the value of flowers, it will turn into a precious gift. Listing all the flowers in nature is impossible. Therefore, we will talk about the flowers of love, their symbolism, and meaning.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7e0c5d7f2aa8d88.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool Walt Whitman quotes on love, nature and the meaning of life</span></p></a><h3>10.

An ancient legend says that a handsome and proud young man named Narcissus would live long if he did not see his reflection. But one day while hunting, Narcissus saw his reflection in a river and fell in love with it. He could not part with it and died of suffering and hunger. A beautiful flower grew on this place.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, the flower narcissus is considered a symbol of vanity and narcissism.

Since then forget-me-not is considered a symbol of constancy, loyalty, and remembrance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f53466892eff4e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Zen quotes that will keep you calm and peaceful</span></p></a><h3>8.

It grew up in the gardens of Babylon more than 4,000 years ago. The wild rose is even more ancient. Its remains were dated 3.5 million years ago. The ancients explained the beauty of the rose by the fact that gods created it. According to the legend, the Greek goddess Cloris accidentally discovered a dead nymph and turned her into a flower. Aphrodite added beauty, brightness, joy, and charm. Dionysus filled it with fragrant nectar, and the western wind Zephyr inflated the clouds so that Apollo could irrigate the rose in the sunlight. Then the flower was called the "Queen of Flowers" and was given to the god of love Eros.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9230ffab4a6d07ef.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best butterfly quotes, sayings and poems</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cd28a2e54dcdf6a1.jpg><p class=align-left>The Romans have their own version of the origin of the rose. According to their legend, a beautiful girl named Rodant had a lot of admirers, but she did not love them. These young people were so full of love and desire that they once broke down the doors of her house and burst inside. Goddess Diana was angry by this story, so she turned the girl into a flower, and her admirers — into thorns, to teach them a lesson.</p><p class=align-left>In Christian history, it was considered a paradise flower, and a bed of newlyweds was often decorated with these beautiful flowers. Over time, the rose became closely associated with Vіrgin Mary, who was depicted surrounded by rose bushes in paradise. Archangel Gabriel weaved three wreaths for Vіrgin Mary: a wreath of red, a wreath of white and a wreath of yellow roses. A wreath of white symbolised joy, of yellow — a recognition of holiness, of red ones — suffering. Red roses have also become a symbol of the suffering of Christ, who shed the blood in the name of the people living on earth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f4daa8010ab811b4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 moon quotes that will inspire you</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ca8a13c268433a55.jpg><p class=align-left>The rose is undoubtedly the most famous symbol of beauty and love.
