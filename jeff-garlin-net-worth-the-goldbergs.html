However, most of us weren't pushed to leave a hit primetime show like actor and comedian <a href=#>Jeff Garlin</a> was (not to say he didn't deserve it). For those who live under a rock, Jeff Garlin portrayed irritable patriarch Murray Goldberg on ABC's '80s-set sitcom <a href=#>The Goldbergs</a> from Season 1 to mid-Season 9, before <a href=#>"exiting" the show</a> last December.</p><p>Several misconduct allegations (including verbal and emotional abuse and the derogatory use of the word "vagina"), HR investigations, and stubbornness to follow guidelines led to Jeff's inevitable demise. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, he also wound up trash-talking The Goldbergs while performing at a Hollywood Improv comedy show in late November 2021, saying he detests the series and only did it for the sweet paycheck.</p><p>Despite the very public drama that has surrounded the arguably "canceled" (who's to say, really) ex-star of The Goldbergs, those hefty paychecks surely added digits to his net worth from 2013 to 2021.</p><p>With such a vast catalog of work in the realms of acting, stand-up comedy, directing, and producing, Jeff has racked up big Hollywood bucks over his four decades in showbiz. So, what is Jeff Garlin's net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Jeff Garlin's net worth?</h2><p>Among the slew of roles Jeff Garlin has under his belt, he's best known for his longtime portrayal of Jeff Greene, <a href=#>Larry David</a>'s friend and manager on HBO's <a href=#>Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>. He also serves as one of its executive producers. The series has been on since 2000, though it took a lengthy hiatus from late 2011 to 2017 before returning for its ninth season.</p><p>His dedication to the series has earned him much of his net worth, which, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, amasses about $15 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Jeff Garlin</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor, Writer, Director, Producer, and Stand-up comedian</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $15 million</p><p>Jeff Garlin is an American stand-up comedian and Emmy-nominated actor known for his work in comedy series like The Goldbergs and Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p><p><strong>Birth date: </strong>June 5, 1962</p><p><strong>Birth place: </strong>Chicago, I.L.</p><p><strong>Marriage: </strong>Marla Garlin (1994 - 2018)</p><p><strong>Children:</strong> Duke Garlin, James Garlin</p><p><strong>Education: </strong>University of Miami</p><p>Jeff's net worth will only get bigger in 2022 as he's starring in the upcoming Foo Fighters-themed horror flick (?) Studio 666. He's also set to appear in the period drama Babylon, which is written and directed by <a href=#>La La Land</a>'s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damien Chazelle</a>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the recent bad press regarding his behavior, Jeff warmly plans to use all of this hard-earned money to financially care for his ex-wife, Marla Garlin. (That's not a sentence you see every day.)</p><p>"We're at the end of our divorce. [It's] very amicable and it will be amicable because I love her, I love her madly, I do," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff told renowned divorce attorney</a> Laura Wasser on a 2020 episode of her podcast, All's Fair. "You know, sometimes you can't be with someone anymore," he continued. "But I love her and I respect her. And I also know that I'm going to take care of her for the rest of her life. I want to be friends with her forever."</p><p>That might just be the most mature thing we've ever heard Jeff say.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnsoygmKukmaN6r7HTZq6oqqSderW0xGaeqKSUl7Kzs9I%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./camilo-ritmo-y-color-mcdonalds-concert.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch (and Vote for) Camilo's Ritmo y Color McDonald's Concerts">&larr;
