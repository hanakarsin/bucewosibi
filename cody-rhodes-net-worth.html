His father, Virgil Runnels (aka Dusty Rhodes), is one of the greatest wrestlers and talkers in the history of the sport. His half-brother, fellow wrestler Dustin Rhodes, is also quite famous for his skills.</p><p>In 2006, Cody decided to follow in Dustin's footsteps and join the WWE.

Everybody I talked to thinks Vince loves the idea of acquiring a co-founder and EVP and, you know, main event wrestler," Wade added. "He just held their secondary singles title not that long ago, and having him show up on WWE TV is something that Vince is very interested in taking advantage of and making money on it. It could even be a situation where Cody is in a major match at WrestleMania."</p><p>As of the time of writing, neither Cody nor the WWE has confirmed his return to the organization. However, Wade maintained, "I fully expect Cody to be on WrestleMania either as a wrestler or making his first appearance."</p><p>At this point in the game, only time will tell!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLylxYyrn6iclah6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./311167-former-machakos-senator-johnson-muthama-free-evict-wife-posh-home-court-rules-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former Machakos senator Johnson Muthama free to evict ex-wife from posh home, court rules">&larr;
